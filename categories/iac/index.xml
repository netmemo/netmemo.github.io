      <description>This article is to show an example of how to manage NSX-T firewall rules as a code through Terraform. You can find the project on my github account : nsxt-frac-tf-cm and nsxt-frac-tf-rm
I will describe the structure of the project, how it works, the data model, the Terraform code explanation and finish with an example.
