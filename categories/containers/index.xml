      <description>This post is more oriented to network engineer that want to start diving in the system and container world.

I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled a lot with various issues to deploy Cilium on Kind cluster. I&amp;rsquo;ve got also issues when I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to setup the cluster mesh with kind.</description>
