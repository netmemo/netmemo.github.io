      <description>This is a memo regarding NSX-T uplinks. I think this is the most confusing and difficult part to understand in NSX-T. This post is made of 3 sections, Diagram with a more visual approach, Component with remarks/comments on uplinks components and a Q&amp;amp;A section based on questions I was asking myself. You can find duplicate information but slightly rephrased in every section. I kept it that way as some time some form are easier to understand than other.</description>
