      <description>For a short A entry TTL Does the resolver keep the 2 GTM IPs and query the second if the first doesn�t reply ? I think so and then I need to change my explaination.
Client keep using A until TTL has expired. If A is 30 second and outage occure just after the DNS request for A, the outage last 30 seconds.
Then the client ask the resolver who might query the GTM NS IP of the broken site, wait for the DNS query timeout then query the working GTM NS that will return the working A entry.</description>
