      <description>Original design 
This is the starting point of the infrastructure. A classic design that lot of enterprise have or use to have. Virtual Machine (VM) and Bare Metal Server (BMS) are sharing a same vlan behind a firewall. Everything begins when the VM want to move to a more virtual infrastructure with distributed routing and firewalling. In this case they want to move to VMware NSXT.
From a physical point of view, the migration is performed on leaf and spine infrastructure that we will call the underlay.</description>

      <description>Context Can we ping the ENI of an AWS Lambda function within the VPC ? While the answer can be obvious the path to get it was insightful for me and has helped me to be more comfortable with :
 AWS IAM.
 AWS Lambdas function.
 AWS Static IP addresses and AWS default subnets.
  This test can be performed with the AWS free tier. You will find the Terraform scripts here : Lambda Ping</description>
