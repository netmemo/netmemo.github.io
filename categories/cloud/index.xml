      <description>This post is to show an example of using CI/CD with Terraform Cloud and Github Actions in order to have a better NetDevOps approach by doing NSX-T Network Infrastructure as code (IaC). It&amp;rsquo;s almost a bingo, I think I have most of the buzz words of these last years :)
I will describe the structure of the project, the project components, the project workflow and finish with how to test this project.</description>
