      <description>This article is to show an exemple of how to manage NSX-T firewall rules as a code through Terraform.
You can find the project on my github account : nsxt-fwaas-tf-cm and nsxt-fwaas-tf-rm
I will describe the structure of the project, the Terraform code then finish with an exemple.
The below diagram show a summary of how I organized the project in order to fully use infrastructre as code.</description>
