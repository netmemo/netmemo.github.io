      <description>The below steps are what I did to create a terraform-bundle to use terraform with non default providers on a server that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have access to Internet. You can find the tool explanation in the below link.
https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/tree/master/tools/terraform-bundle
installation of golang with msi downloaded here
https://golang.org/doc/install
Clone the terraform repository to get the tool
https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform.git
cd terraform-master go install .\tools\terraform-bundle  Check the terraform version C:\Users\noyel\Desktop\tfforeach\nsxt&amp;gt;terraform version Terraform v0.14.6 + provider registry.</description>
