      <description>Below are some thoughts about subnet sizing and workloads mixing.
Along my different jobs one of the things that leads to L2 extension and those brought risks and slow down or even block projects was big heterogeneous subnets.
Small subnets size: Pros  Agility, you can do swimlane application design and do migration per application without geopardise the entire compagny.
  Cons  More entry in the routing table but that can be mitigated with summarization.</description>
