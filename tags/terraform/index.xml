      <description>The below steps are what I did to create a terraform-bundle to use terraform with non default providers on a server that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have access to Internet. You can find the tool explanation in the below link.
https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/tree/master/tools/terraform-bundle
installation of golang with msi downloaded here
https://golang.org/doc/install
Clone the terraform repository to get the tool
https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform.git
cd terraform-master go install .\tools\terraform-bundle  Check the terraform version C:\Users\noyel\Desktop\tfforeach\nsxt&amp;gt;terraform version Terraform v0.14.6 + provider registry.</description>

      <description>An extended explanation of the differences between for_each, for and count can be find on the below link
https://blog.gruntwork.io/terraform-tips-tricks-loops-if-statements-and-gotchas-f739bbae55f9
The two main drawback of using count are :
- Can&amp;rsquo;t be used to loop over inline blocks
- Difficult to remove entry from a list because it change the index and those Terraform may want to destroy same resource with different index
Below are the an exemple of the variables used to create subnets within AWS VPCs and the main file with the for_each.</description>
