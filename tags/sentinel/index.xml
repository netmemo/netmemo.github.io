      <description>This blog is a minimalist example of a Hashicorp Sentinel policy to check the content of a string variable. I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled a bit to write my first policy and had difficulties to understand all the needed elements.
Hashicorps sentinel policy are policies as code that will allow you to control what users are pushing through Terraform Enterprise/Cloud. This is a paid feature, Open Policy Agent is the open source alternative.</description>
