      <description>QoS VOQ On N5K, In the case of unicast traffic, VOQ is an ingress buffer pool for 3 ingress ports (1 ASIC = 3 ports). This buffer pool is split into n x reservable buffer of the size configured in the voq-limit command. If the ingress buffer is 16000 and the VOQ limit is 1024, that mean 16 flow can reserv buffers. When the shared buffer is exausted, the dedicated ingress buffer per port is used then when it&amp;rsquo;s full, the packet is droped.</description>
