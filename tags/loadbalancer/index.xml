      <description>For a short A record TTL Client keep using A until TTL has expired. If A is 30 second and outage occure just after the DNS request for A record, the outage last 30 seconds.
Wen A has expired, the client browser query the resolver who might query the GSLB NS of the broken site, wait for the DNS query timeout then query the working GSLB NS that will return the working A record.</description>
