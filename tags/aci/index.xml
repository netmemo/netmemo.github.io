      <description>&amp;ldquo;Several of these protocols are standards&amp;rdquo; My understanding is that even if the protocols look standard, Cisco made some modifications on them : VXLAN (fiels to transport ACI Policies), ISIS (added the multidestination tree) and hence are note standard anymore.
&amp;ldquo;Does it require proprietary server ?&amp;rdquo; Not prorietary servers but proprietary switches&amp;hellip;So you are locked in regarding the software and the hardware. Both can&amp;rsquo;t be decoupled. If you choose to move to another switch vendor, you need to change the hardware and sart learning new software and protocols skills.</description>
