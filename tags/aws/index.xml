      <description>An extended explanation of the differences between for_each, for and count can be find on the below link
https://blog.gruntwork.io/terraform-tips-tricks-loops-if-statements-and-gotchas-f739bbae55f9

- Can&amp;rsquo;t be used to loop over inline blocks
- Difficult to remove entry from a list because it change the index and those Terraform may want to destroy same resource with different index
